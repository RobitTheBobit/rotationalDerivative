theta = input("Please enter theta (derivative value): ");
c = input("Please enter c value: ");
% temporary x line until I get my function outputting normally
x = input("Please enter a specific x value: ")

"The thetath Rotational Derivative is Equal to..."
result = c^theta * sin(c*x + theta * (pi / 2))
